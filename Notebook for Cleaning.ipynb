The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, there were around 23,357 inhabitants.

Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse, and a high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken.</td>\n",

       "0  Indische Buurt (\"Indies Neighborhood\") is a neighbourhood in the eastern portion of the city of Amsterdam, in the Dutch province of Noord-Holland. The name dates from the early 20th century and is derived from the fact that the neighbourhood's streets are named after islands and other geographical concepts in the former Dutch colony of the Dutch East Indies. The first street was named in 1902. In 2003, there were around 23,357 inhabitants. The neighbourhood is bounded on the west by the railroad Amsterdam - Hilversum (with the Muiderpoort Station), on the east side by Flevopark, on the north side by Zeeburgerdijk and on the south side by the Ringvaart Watergraafsmeer. Indische Buurt is the oldest part of the Zeeburg district and is very ethnically diverse, and a high percentage of the population is of immigrant origin (for Zeeburg this is already high at 55%, but higher in the Indische Buurt) and there are an estimated 100 languages spoken.   \n",

And when it's hot, check out the Bredius open air swimming pool - a 5 minute walk.  There are some great restaurants at walking distance, like Morris & Bella, Freud, Bar Mick and Pinsa's Pizzeria (all on Spaarndammerstraat). Jump on your bicycle and enjoy a fantastic view at the IJ river when dining at Pont 13 (boat) or on the upper floar of REM eiland.

He needs some extra tender loving care at his age and, if you stay more than 2 nights, we recommend you change his litter box... just for your own sake! ;-)  The municipality of Amsterdam has become VERY strict when it comes to Airbnb, so forgive us for being strict, too. We do not allow more than 4 people to stay in our house. Drug use is not allowed. Should we get any complaints of the neighbors during your stay, the reservation will be cancelled immediately, with no refund.  It would be great if you could take out the trash before you leave.   \n",

He needs some extra tender loving care at his age and, if you stay more than 2 nights, we recommend you change his litter box... just for your own sake! ;-)  The municipality of Amsterdam has become VERY strict when it comes to Airbnb, so forgive us for being strict, too. We do not allow more than 4 people to stay in our house. Drug use is not allowed. Should we get any complaints of the neighbors during your stay, the reservation will be cancelled immediately, with no refund.

He needs some extra tender loving care at his age and, if you stay more than 2 nights, we recommend you change his litter box... just for your own sake! ;-)  The municipality of Amsterdam has become VERY strict when it comes to Airbnb, so forgive us for being strict, too. We do not allow more than 4 people to stay in our house. Drug use is not allowed. Should we get any complaints of the neighbors during your stay, the reservation will be cancelled immediately, with no refund.
